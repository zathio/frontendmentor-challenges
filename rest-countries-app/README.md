## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JS
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/)

### What I learned

Building an app with vanilla js helped a lot to understand more about modern javascript.
I'm also a bit surprised that I never felt limited or stuck with this vanilla approach, it was quite a good experience and I didn't felt the need to move on a front end framework for this project.

Building a simple router seemed a bit challening at first but after multiple ideas I ended up writting a solution not too complex that I'm happy about.

I built my first skeleton loader and it was fun to design something similar to the final content, I can't imagine the app without any type of loading while it's fetching data and I believe the skeleton screen was the best suited for this app;

The theme toggling feature between light and dark mode was easy with Tailwind CSS.

It was great to practice fetch requests by working with an api.
